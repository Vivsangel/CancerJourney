I've created a comprehensive prostate cancer staging system that fully implements SOLID principles and incorporates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Here are the key components:
SOLID Principles Implementation:

Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose

ConfigManager: Manages configuration
CancerStage: Data structure for staging information
Individual processors for each data type


Open/Closed: Abstract base classes allow extension without modification

DataProcessor base class with specialized implementations
BaseModel for all neural network models


Liskov Substitution: All derived classes can replace base classes

Any model inheriting from BaseModel works with trainer/evaluator
All processors implement the same interface


Interface Segregation: Separate interfaces for different concerns

DataLoader, Trainer, Evaluator interfaces
Client code only depends on needed interfaces


Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions

Pipeline depends on abstract Trainer and Evaluator
Concrete implementations injected at runtime



Advanced Deep Learning Features:

Multi-Modal Fusion:

MRI segmentation using 3D U-Net
Pathology classification with EfficientNet
Clinical data processing with neural networks
Attention-based fusion of all modalities


Modern Architectures:

Transformer blocks for feature fusion
Graph Neural Networks for spatial relationships
Mixed precision training for efficiency
